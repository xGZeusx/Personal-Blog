## 📄 About This Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. As an aspiring IT Support Specialist, I built this site from scratch to showcase my hands-on technical projects and provide tangible proof of my skills in place of a traditional work history.

The site details my journey and capabilities through a series of in-depth project case studies, including:
* Building a custom PC from scratch
* Engineering an all-in-one game console and home server
* Building a Raspberry Pi MIDI LED visualizer
* Setting up a personal cloud-gaming environment
* ...and more.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Semantic HTML5:** For a clean, accessible, and well-structured site.
* **Responsive CSS3:** Using modern Flexbox and Grid layouts to ensure the site looks professional on all devices.

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is published using **GitHub Pages**. New commits to the `main` branch are served as the site source. A `CNAME` file at the repository root configures the custom domain.

Netlify-specific deployment files (such as `_redirects` and `_headers`) have been archived to `deploy/netlify/` for reference.

## 🎯 My Goal

The projects on this site are intended to demonstrate the practical, real-world experience I've gained while pursuing my passion for IT. I am a proactive, hands-on learner and am excited to bring these problem-solving skills to a professional IT support role.
